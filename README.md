### TO DO:
Simple Invoice module which is approving or rejecting single invoice using information from existing approval module which tells if the given resource is approvable / rejectable. Only 3 endpoints are required:
```
  - Show Invoice data, like in the list above
  - Approve Invoice
  - Reject Invoice
```
* In this task you must save only invoices so don‚Äôt write repositories for every model/ entity.

* You should be able to approve or reject each invoice just once (if invoice is approved you cannot reject it and vice versa.

* You can assume that product quantity is integer and only currency is USD.

* Proper seeder is located in Invoice module and it‚Äôs named DatabaseSeeder

* In .env.example proper connection to database is established.

* Using proper DDD structure is preferred (with elements like entity, value object, repository, mapper / proxy, DTO) but not mandatory.
Unit tests in plus.

* Docker is in docker catalog and you need only do 
  ```
  ./start.sh
  ``` 
  to make everything work

  docker container is in docker folder. To connect with it just:
  ```
  docker compose exec workspace bash
  ```
